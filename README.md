# The Assassin Origin
The Assassin origin is created for the [Origins Minecraft Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins), which is a required dependency. It currently has support for version 1.10.0 of the Origins Mod (which is the version available on **Minecraft 1.20** and **1.20.1**) though it may work on others.
[Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui) is an optional (though recommended) dependency, it gives some extra functionality to the Assassin's Sneaky Capabilities.
Downloads can be found on the [Releases page of the Github Repo](https://github.com/imaradio/assassin-origin/releases).

## Overview
The Assassin is generally a stealth origin, though it has various powers that make it suitable for other playstyles, such as utility and combat.

### Smokes
The Assassin is able to use multiple smokes, with varying effects, in order to achieve its goals. Where an item is needed, it is shown in (Brackets), and can be placed in the offhand to be added to the smoke, unless otherwise specified.

A comprehensive list is as follows:
- Base (No Item) this will create a cloud of smoke around the Assassin, useful for quick cover.
- Poison (Spider Eye) will create a deadly cloud, causing nearby entities to become infected with a poison.
- Blindness (Sand) will create a miniature dust storm, causing nearby entities to become temporarily blinded as they try rub sand from their eyes.
- Moist (Water Bucket) will create a wet smoke, cable of extinguishing the player.
- Extractive (Amethyst) will blow apart the crystals placed inside the smoke, extracting XP.
- Waypoint (Ender Pearl) will Set, Goto, or Discard a waypoint.
	- Set: when held in the mainhand, Primary will Set the waypoint.
	- Goto: when held in the offhand, Primary will Goto the waypoint.
	- Discard: when held in the offhand, Save Toolbar will Discard the waypoint.
- Shell (Scute) will give the Assassin and those around them great defensive capabilities, at the cost of very little movement.
- Glow (Glowstone Dust) will light up those around the Assassin, making them much more noticeable targets.
- Blaze (Blaze Powder) will set on fire the area around the Assassin, along with those in the way.
- Chorus (Chorus Fruit) will amplify the effects of the Chorus Fruit, spreading the Assassin and those nearby a random distance from where they used to stand.

### Sneaky Capabilities
By nature of the occupation, the Assassin has learnt to become very sneaky, and virtually undetectable the majority of the time.
When sneaking, the Assassin becomes completely invisble. However when hit by another entity, or when hitting another entity, they become visible for a second.

Due to sneaking around so often, the Assassin also learnt to be quick about it.

### Miscellaneous
- Smoke Bombs act as your defense, so you have no need for shields.
- The Assassin deals more damage when attacking from behind. (authored by eggohito, see `/LICENSE.md` for details)
- Being sneaky has led to the Assassin becoming the Master Rock Climber, since they often need to hang from walls.
- Climbing carefully down from walls isn't usually an option, so the Assassin has learnt to take a fall
- The Assassin _must_ move quickly.
